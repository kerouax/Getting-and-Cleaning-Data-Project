## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of this script (run_analysis.R) is to collect and clean a data downloaded from web. The goal is to prepare tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.  A complete description of the data used in this script can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). Original data source can be downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

### What are the script objectives?

The script should do the following:
* It merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Additional Information
The additional information on the variables can be found in the CodeBook.MD file.
